# What is LIRI?

Instead of asking *what* is LIRI, you should be asking *who* is LIRI...? LIRI is like the iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node application that will take in parameters from the user and return some data.

## How does it work?

LIRI can currently take in 4 different commands. Those commands are `concert-this`, `spotify-this-song`, `movie-this`, and `do-what-it-says`. First you want to navigate to the directory that liri is in like so:
